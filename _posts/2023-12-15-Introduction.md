## Introduction
What's up! Welcome to my website. The name's Vincent or just 'Vince'.
I am currently majoring in Computer Science and started programming in 2020. Not very sure what kind of field of computer science that I will pursue in the future, but I do know that I enjoy learning how programs and computers work. I want to be able to get on a computer, code it, and make it do wonderful things.There are so many things that computer can do, they're very versatile and play a major role in our day-to-day lives. With the growing advancement of technology, computers will be able to perform more tasks optimality. This is why I chose to major in computer science. Also, I just like video games lol.


## What is this website?
This is website was created with the sole purpose of writing my thoughts or random topics that I'm currently interested in. Kinda like an exchange diary except I'm the only one writing in it. A solo exchange diary. I'll be mainly focusing on personal reviews of video games, mostly JRPGs and explain tidbits on video game code and their development. Maybe I'll post some art and tell a little about it if I'm feeling confident.

During this year, I finished a lot of video games and I wanted a way to catalog what games I finished, how many hours I spent on it, and what's my overall thoughts of the game were. At first, I created an spreadsheet but it wasn't very appealing and I wanted to share my thoughts with others. Using my experience in my Web App Development class, I decided to use what I learned and create a website that fulfills that idea. I wish I created this website at the beginning of the year because I finished a lot of my backlog of games throughout this year where my thoughts and experience were still fresh.
